/**
 *             Textbook Example Program
 * Class:      Length Converter.java
 * Purpose:    This program will convert measurements expressed in inches,
 *             feet, yards, or miles into each of the possible units of measure.
 *             The measurement is input by the user, followed by the unit of
 *             measure. The measurement is input by the user, followed by the
 *             unit of measure. For example: "17 feet", "1 inch", or "2.73 mi".
 *             Abbreviations "in", "ft", "yd", and "mi" are accepted. The
 *             program will continue to read and convert measurements until the
 *             user enters an input of 0.
