/**
 *              Textbook Example Program
 * Class:       ComputeAverage2.java
 * Purpose:     This program reads a sequence of positive integers input by the 
 *              user, and it will print out the average of those integers. The
 *              user is prompted to enter one integer at time. The user must
 *              enter a 0 to mark the end of the data. (The zero is not counted 
 *              as part of the data to be averaged.) The program does not check 
 *              whether the userâ€™s input is positive, so it will actually add up
 *              both positive and negative input values.
