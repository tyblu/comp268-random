/**
 *             Textbook Example Program
 * Class:      ComputeAverage.java
 * Purpose:    This program reads a sequence of positive integers input by the
 *             user, and it will print out the average of those integers. The
 *             user is prompted to enter one integer at time. The user must
 *             enter a 0 to mark the end of the data. (The zero is not counted
 *             as part of the data to be averaged.) The program does not check
 *             whether the userâ€™s input is positive, so it will actually add up
 *             both positive and negative input values.
