/**
 * <h1>Chapter 6 - Exercise 3</h1>
 * 
 * Rolls and shows the resultant pair of dice values on a screen. Click the
 * window to roll again.
 * 
 * <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
 * <p>Write a program that shows a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the
 * panel in the program, the dice should be rolled (that is, the dice should be
 * assigned newly computed random values). Each die should be drawn as the
 * square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw two dice, it's a
 * good idea to write a subroutine like 
 * {@code void drawDie(Graphics g, int val, int x, int y)} to draw a die at the
 * specified {@code (x,y)} coordinates. The second parameter, @{code val},
 * specifies the value that is showing on the die. Assume that the size of the
 * panel is 100 by 100 pixels.
