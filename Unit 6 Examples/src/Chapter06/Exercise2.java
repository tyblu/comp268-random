/**
 * <h1>Chapter 6 - Exercise 2</h1>
 * 
 * Presents a window with a red square and a blue square, either of which can
 * be moved around with the mouse. Dragging it outside of the window makes it
 * inaccessible.
 * 
 * <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
 * <p>Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue square.
 * The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse. (You'll need
 * an instance variable to remember which square the user is dragging.) The
 * user can drag the square out of the panel if she wants; if she does this, 
 * there is no way to get it back.
 * <p>Note that for this exercise, you should do all the drawing in the
 * {@code paintComponent()} method (as indeed you should whenever possible).
