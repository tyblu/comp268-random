/**

 * Class:       MainCaller.java
 * Purpose:     Used to call and test methods and classes in Chapter 7.
 *              Set the appropriate boolean to {@code true} to run the
 *              {@code call()} routine in the associated class. It may be
 *              necessary to set all other boolean variables to {@code false},
 *              as there may be conflicts.
